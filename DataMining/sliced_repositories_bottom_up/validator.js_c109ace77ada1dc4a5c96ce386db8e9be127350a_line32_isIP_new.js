/**
11.3.  Examples

   The following addresses

             fe80::1234 (on the 1st link of the node)
             ff02::5678 (on the 5th link of the node)
             ff08::9abc (on the 10th organization of the node)

   would be represented as follows:

             fe80::1234%1
             ff02::5678%5
             ff08::9abc%10

   (Here we assume a natural translation from a zone index to the
   <zone_id> part, where the Nth zone of any scope is translated into
   "N".)

   If we use interface names as <zone_id>, those addresses could also be
   represented as follows:

            fe80::1234%ne0
            ff02::5678%pvc1.3
            ff08::9abc%interface10

   where the interface "ne0" belongs to the 1st link, "pvc1.3" belongs
   to the 5th link, and "interface10" belongs to the 10th organization.
